    application. IOT based health monitoring system Developed a device
    using the module Node-MCU (Wi-Fi) to monitor our health using
    Pressure sensor, Temperature sensor and Heart beat sensor. Fire
    Alarm 1, Fire Alarm 2 and Heat Detectors Circuit of Heat sensor,
    Fire alarm and Types of fire alarm are implemented. Traffic Light
    Systems for 4 Crossing Roads Implementation of Traffic Light Systems
    for 4 Crossing Roads using LabVIEW with the State Machine
    Architecture. Round Robin Arbiter 4 master and 1 slave concepts have
    been implemented using Model Sim (Verilog) in the round robin
    arbiter fashion. It is desired that 4 independent processors in
    system require access to same set of shared resources Memory of
    64KB. Wind Magnetic Current Generator (mini project) To produce
    current, a device has been developed using magnets and coils. If the
    air is blown, magnets attached to tapes starts to swing, current is
    induced in the wounded coil and measured with the help of
    Multi-meter.`,
